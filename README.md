Wlcome to Diamond
The online software for learning robotics and coding

It consists of two main parts

1. The online coding editor
2. The games

The coding editor is powered by Google blockly providing an easy-to-use drag and drop coding experience
The games also use blockly but there is more.
With the power of phaser.js we add a game layer on top of the coding experience. With 20, levels to pass each level instead of strumming buttons you have to pass a coding difficulty
